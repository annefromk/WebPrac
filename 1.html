  <h6><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ns0ATWC46c4&t=7s" target="_blank">Here is the video</a> I made of <u>my Cebu trip</u> that Mary and I went on this past February, which we literally booked our flights and hotel for just 2 days before we actually left. Yes, it was a quick and spontaneous decision. We didn't have any specific plans for this trip but it turned out to be the best. We spent 3 whole days doing nothing but swimming, chilling under the palm trees, drinking so much coconut water, riding bikes along the beach, and trying out a stand-up paddling board. It was so relaxing, refreshing, and fun! 🌴🦎👙🏊‍♀️🚲🍺🍽😊

  <p style = "margin-top:45px;">The lesson we learned from this trip was that we need to give ourselves a break from time to time, especially when there are many things going on in life. Being spontaneous is a good thing sometimes, because you never know what adventures await you along the way.
  .And I've also been enjoying video editing. It reminds me of all the good times I had that time. <br>Anyway, hope you guys enjoy watching!:)
